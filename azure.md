**Authentication & User Identity** refers to **verifying who the user is** (authentication) and **what they are allowed to do** (authorization). It‚Äôs a foundational step in securing your app and personalizing the experience.

- ChatGPT: [Group-based constrian enforcement](https://chatgpt.com/share/68f7dc73-4de0-8003-9060-fc942f286c88)

Here‚Äôs how you can implement it for your Flask app on Azure:

---

### üîê **1. Authentication: Let Users Log In**

You want users to sign in securely, either as individuals or part of a group (e.g., company team).

#### ‚úÖ Recommended for Production: **Azure AD B2C**

Azure AD B2C is a customer identity service that lets you:

- Enable **email/password login**, **Google**, **Microsoft**, etc.
- Manage users, groups, and roles
- Securely integrate with your Flask app using OpenID Connect (OIDC)

##### üîß Steps:

1. **Create an Azure AD B2C tenant**
2. **Register your Flask app** (as an application) in the B2C tenant
3. **Configure user flows** (sign up, sign in)
4. Use a Python library like `Flask-OIDC` or `MSAL` to authenticate users

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Authorization: Control Access by Role or Group**

After login, you get a JWT token that includes user information.

From there, in your Flask app:

- Decode the token (`pyjwt`, `MSAL`, or Flask-OIDC)
- Extract claims like:

  ```json
  {
    "sub": "user_id_abc",
    "emails": ["user@example.com"],
    "groups": ["groupA", "groupB"]
  }
  ```

- Use this info to:

  - Query the database for the right group/tenant
  - Set session context for RLS (`sp_set_session_context`)
  - Control what data is shown or editable

---

### üîÑ Simplified Option (MVP Stage)

If you're just testing or early-stage, you can:

- Use **Flask-Login** for local email/password
- Store users and roles in your own Azure SQL table
- Handle login manually

Later, you can switch to Azure AD B2C without reworking everything.

| Layer             | Your Tool / Tech                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Identity Provider | **Azure AD B2C**                       |
| Login Integration | Flask + MSAL / Flask-OIDC              |
| Token Decoding    | `pyjwt`, `Flask-OIDC`, or `MSAL`       |
| Access Logic      | RLS in DB + role/group checks in Flask |

# example of setting up Azure AD B2C + Flask with login and group-based access control

Here‚Äôs how you can integrate Azure AD B2C authentication into your Flask + React + Azure App Service architecture ‚Äî I‚Äôll walk through the **high‚Äëlevel flow**, the **Azure portal setup**, and a **sample Flask code snippet** for handling the backend (which you can build upon).

---

## 1. High‚ÄëLevel Flow

1. A user visits your **React frontend** (hosted on Azure Static Web Apps or similar).
2. They click ‚ÄúSign in‚Äù ‚Üí your app redirects to Azure AD B2C‚Äôs ‚ÄúSign up / Sign in‚Äù user flow.
3. They authenticate (email/password, social login, etc.). Azure AD‚ÄØB2C returns an **ID token** (and optionally an access token) to your frontend.
4. The frontend stores the token (typically in memory or secure cookie) and calls your **Flask backend API** with the access token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
5. The Flask backend validates the access token (against Azure AD B2C / MSAL) ‚Üí extracts the **user‚Äôs identity and claims** (e.g., user_id, groups/roles).
6. Based on those claims, your backend can:

   - set the session context (for RLS) in your database, or
   - filter data in code (if not using RLS)

7. The backend returns data to the frontend. The frontend restricts UI elements (menus, etc.) based on roles/groups.

This flow separates **authentication** (who you are) from **authorization** (what you‚Äôre allowed to do).

---

## 2. Azure Portal Setup ‚Äì Key Steps

Here are the main steps to configure Azure AD B2C for your application:

### A. Create an Azure AD‚ÄØB2C Tenant

- In the Azure Portal: create or select an existing Azure AD‚ÄØB2C tenant.
- Link your subscription to it.

### B. Create User Flows (Policies)

- In the B2C tenant, under _User flows (policies)_ create at least:

  - a ‚ÄúSign up‚ÄØ+‚ÄØSign in‚Äù flow (e.g., `B2C_1_SignUpSignIn`)
  - optionally ‚ÄúPassword reset‚Äù, ‚ÄúEdit profile‚Äù flows.
    ([Microsoft Learn][1])

- Configure the attributes/claims you want returned (e.g., `given_name`, `surname`, `email`, maybe custom attribute like `group_id`).

### C. Register your Applications

- **Frontend app registration**:

  - Platform type: SPA or Web (depending on architecture)
  - Redirect URI(s): e.g., `https://yourfrontend.com/auth/callback` or `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (for dev)
  - Enable ‚ÄúID tokens‚Äù and ‚ÄúAccess tokens‚Äù if needed.

- **Backend API registration**:

  - Platform type: Web/API
  - Redirect URI: e.g., `https://yourbackend.com/getAToken` or however your OAuth flow works
  - Configure ‚ÄúExpose an API‚Äù ‚Üí define scopes (e.g., `api.read`, `api.write`) that your frontend will request. ([Microsoft Learn][2])

### D. Configure the frontend to request the scope of the backend API

- When the frontend logs in, it should request scopes for both the ID token and the backend API (so that it can call the backend).
- Example: the scope might be `https://<your‚Äëtenant>.onmicrosoft.com/<backend‚Äëapi‚Äëid>/api.read`.

### E. On the backend side, validate tokens

- Your Flask app must validate the JWT (ID token or access token) using the Azure AD‚ÄØB2C metadata endpoint (OpenID Connect discovery document) to retrieve signing keys.
- Then extract claims (e.g., `oid`, `sub`, `email`, custom attributes).
- Use those claims to enforce authorization (group membership, roles) and set session context for your DB if using row‚Äëlevel security.

---

## 3. Sample Flask Code Snippet

Below is a simplified example of how you might integrate MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) in your Flask backend to validate the token and extract claims. You‚Äôll need to adapt it for your actual setup, error handling, and production security.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, _request_ctx_stack
import msal
import jwt  # PyJWT or equivalent
import requests
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

TENANT = os.getenv("AZURE_B2C_TENANT")           # e.g., "contoso.onmicrosoft.com"
CLIENT_ID = os.getenv("AZURE_B2C_CLIENT_ID")     # from app registration
API_SCOPES = [ os.getenv("AZURE_B2C_API_SCOPE") ] # e.g., "https://contoso.onmicrosoft.com/api/api.read"
POLICY = os.getenv("AZURE_B2C_POLICY")           # e.g., "B2C_1_SignUpSignIn"

# OpenID Connect metadata endpoint for B2C
OPENID_METADATA = f"https://{TENANT}.b2clogin.com/{TENANT}/{POLICY}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration"

# Fetch metadata once at start
openid_config = requests.get(OPENID_METADATA).json()
jwks_uri = openid_config["jwks_uri"]
issuer = openid_config["issuer"]
jwks_keys = requests.get(jwks_uri).json()["keys"]

def validate_token(token):
    # Decode and verify JWT (simplified)
    unverified_header = jwt.get_unverified_header(token)
    # find key
    key = next((k for k in jwks_keys if k["kid"] == unverified_header["kid"]), None)
    if not key:
        raise Exception("Appropriate key not found")
    # Decode
    decoded = jwt.decode(token,
                         key=jwt.algorithms.RSAAlgorithm.from_jwk(key),
                         audience=CLIENT_ID,
                         issuer=issuer,
                         algorithms=["RS256"])
    return decoded

@app.before_request
def authenticate_request():
    auth = request.headers.get("Authorization", None)
    if not auth:
        return jsonify({"error": "Missing header"}), 401
    parts = auth.split()
    if parts[0].lower() != "bearer":
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid header"}), 401
    token = parts[1]
    try:
        claims = validate_token(token)
        # Put claims into flask context
        _request_ctx_stack.top.current_user = claims
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({"error": "Invalid token", "details": str(e)}), 401

@app.route("/api/profile")
def profile():
    user = _request_ctx_stack.top.current_user
    return jsonify({
        "user_id": user.get("oid"),
        "email": user.get("emails") or user.get("email"),
        "name": user.get("name"),
        # custom attribute e.g., group
        "group": user.get("extension_groupId")
    })

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key points in this snippet

- We fetch OIDC metadata (issuer, JWKS) from Azure AD B2C.
- We validate the token‚Äôs signature, issuer, audience.
- We extract the claims (user identity) and attach them to Flask‚Äôs request context.
- We expose route protected by token.
- In real application you‚Äôll add error handling, logging, token caching, scope checking, etc.

---

## 4. Integrating Authorization & Groups for Your Use Case

Since your scenario involves individual users and groups with access‚Äëlevels, here‚Äôs how you can map that into the above architecture:

- In your Azure AD‚ÄØB2C user flows or via Azure AD Graph/API, **assign an attribute** to each user that indicates their **group_id** (or multiple group memberships) or role (admin, user, read‚Äëonly, etc.).
- When user logs in, that attribute is returned in the token (so you‚Äôll need to configure B2C to include it).
- In your Flask backend:

  1. Read `group_id` or `roles` from the claims.
  2. Before querying the DB, set `SESSION_CONTEXT()` (in Azure SQL) to that group_id if you use row‚Äëlevel security (RLS).
  3. Alternatively/Additionally, filter your queries by `group_id = user.group_id` so each user sees only their group‚Äôs data.

- For your data schema: Add a `group_id` column to your domain tables and ensure you always include it in WHERE clauses or enforce via RLS.
- For more advanced setups: You could have roles (e.g., ‚Äúgroup_admin‚Äù, ‚Äúgroup_member‚Äù) and enforce rights (edit, delete, view) both in the backend and optionally in the UI.

---

## 5. What to Do Next ‚Äî Checklist

- [ ] Set up your Azure‚ÄØAD‚ÄØB2C tenant (if not already).
- [ ] Define your user flows (sign‚Äëin/signup, password reset).
- [ ] Configure user attributes (include group_id or custom role).
- [ ] Register your frontend and backend apps in B2C; note the Client IDs, redirect URIs, scopes.
- [ ] Integrate the frontend (React) using MSAL.js or OIDC library to authenticate and acquire access token.
- [ ] Implement the Flask backend token validation logic (as above).
- [ ] Extend the backend logic to read group/role claims and implement authorization.
- [ ] In your Azure SQL database, add the group_id (or tenant_id) columns and consider enforcing row‚Äëlevel security (RLS) if appropriate.
- [ ] Deploy your Flask backend to Azure App Service and configure its settings (e.g., environment variables for tenant, client IDs, secrets).
- [ ] Secure the secrets (client secret) in Azure Key Vault or App Service configuration.
- [ ] When moving to production: enforce HTTPS, validate tokens thoroughly, monitor security, consider multi‚Äëtenant patterns if scaling.

# Enforcing group-based access

Thanks ‚Äî with those environment variables and Entra ID setup, you're in a great place to implement **secure multi-group access**.

Now let's clarify the **backend table design** you need in Azure SQL to:

- Map Entra users (from access tokens) to your internal data
- Enforce group-based row-level access

---

## ‚úÖ Goal Recap

You have Entra groups like:

- `lion-uk-users`
- `lion-fr-users`

Users belong to one or more groups.
Your token includes:

```json
{
  "sub": "abc123",
  "groups": ["lion-uk-users"]
}
```

You want the database to return only data **relevant to that group**.

---

## üß± Recommended Tables in Your Azure SQL Backend

### 1. **users** (optional if you trust token fully)

| Column       | Type     | Notes                             |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| `user_id`    | TEXT     | From `sub` claim in JWT           |
| `email`      | TEXT     | From token (`preferred_username`) |
| `group_name` | TEXT     | One group per row, or normalize   |
| `created_at` | DATETIME | Optional                          |

**Optional table** to persist known users, e.g., audit, config, etc.

---

### 2. **groups** (if using internal group mapping)

| Column        | Type     | Notes                    |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| `group_name`  | TEXT     | Matches Entra group name |
| `description` | TEXT     | Optional                 |
| `region`      | TEXT     | e.g., 'UK', 'FR'         |
| `created_at`  | DATETIME |                          |

**Use this table to normalize group behavior**, such as default permissions or UI flags.

---

### 3. **user_group_memberships** (many-to-many)

| Column       | Type | Notes                     |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------------- |
| `user_id`    | TEXT | From token `sub`          |
| `group_name` | TEXT | FK to `groups.group_name` |

Only needed if you want users to belong to multiple groups internally.

---

### 4. **your_domain_table** (e.g., `shipments`, `schedules`, `resources`)

| Column       | Type | Notes                        |
| ------------ | ---- | ---------------------------- |
| `id`         | INT  | Primary key                  |
| `group_name` | TEXT | Used for row-level filtering |
| `created_by` | TEXT | Optional ‚Äî for user tracking |
| `...`        | ...  | Domain-specific data         |

This is where you enforce **group-based access**:

- Filter on `group_name = current_user_group`
- Or use RLS based on session context

---

## üîê Enforcement Options

### A. In Flask App (simpler for now)

```python
user_groups = g.user.get("groups", [])
query = f"""
SELECT * FROM shipments WHERE group_name IN ({','.join(['?']*len(user_groups))})
"""
cursor.execute(query, user_groups)
```

### B. In SQL (Recommended later ‚Äî secure & scalable)

1. Add row-level security (RLS) policy on `group_name`
2. From Flask, call:

```sql
EXEC sp_set_session_context 'group_name', 'lion-uk-users';
```

3. Then SQL automatically filters rows.

---

## üåê Mapping Claims to DB Access

| JWT Claim            | SQL Usage                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `sub`                | `user_id` in tables       |
| `groups`             | `group_name` in rows      |
| `preferred_username` | optional `email` tracking |

---

## üìù Summary Schema (Minimal)

```sql
-- Domain data table
CREATE TABLE shipments (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  group_name NVARCHAR(100),
  description TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME
);

-- Groups metadata
CREATE TABLE groups (
  group_name NVARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
  region NVARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

## Question:

Enforcement is what i am looking for. I have the fields group_name an user_id bit do not want to add to my queries in my flask app. I think Optin B is better for tht purpoise. SO i jsut run literally "EXEC sp_set_session_context 'group_name', 'lion-uk-users';" or can be difefrent?

**Answer**

Yes ‚Äî you are absolutely on the right track! Since you already have the `group_name` and `user_id` fields in your tables, and you want to **avoid manually filtering in every SQL query**, **Option B (Row-Level Security using `SESSION_CONTEXT`)** is the perfect and scalable solution.

---

## ‚úÖ What Is `sp_set_session_context`?

`sp_set_session_context` is a built-in SQL Server procedure that allows your **Flask app to securely pass values to SQL** (like `group_name`) at the **session level**. You set it once after connecting, and **every SQL statement in that session can use it** ‚Äî especially useful with **Row-Level Security (RLS)**.

---

## ‚úÖ What You Need To Do

### üîπ 1. **Create RLS Security Predicate in SQL**

Assume your domain table is like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE shipments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    group_name NVARCHAR(100),
    shipment_data NVARCHAR(MAX),
    created_by NVARCHAR(100)
);
```

Create a **predicate function**:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fn_securitypredicate_groupname(@group_name AS NVARCHAR(100))
RETURNS TABLE
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
RETURN SELECT 1 AS fn_securitypredicate_groupname
WHERE @group_name = CAST(SESSION_CONTEXT(N'group_name') AS NVARCHAR(100));
```

Create a **security policy** using that:

```sql
CREATE SECURITY POLICY GroupNameFilter
ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.fn_securitypredicate_groupname(group_name)
ON dbo.shipments
WITH (STATE = ON);
```

---

### üîπ 2. **Set Session Context in Flask Before Queries**

Yes, you literally run this in Flask:

```python
cursor.execute("EXEC sp_set_session_context @key=N'group_name', @value=?;", (user_group,))
```

This sets the session context to your user‚Äôs group (e.g., `'lion-uk-users'`), and SQL Server will **automatically apply your RLS filter**.

Every subsequent query like this:

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM shipments")
```

‚Ä¶will **only return rows where `group_name = 'lion-uk-users'`**, enforced securely at the SQL level.

---

### üîπ 3. **How to Use Multiple Groups (Optional)**

SQL Server RLS with `SESSION_CONTEXT` only supports **one value per key**, so if a user belongs to multiple groups (e.g., `['lion-uk-users', 'lion-fr-users']`), you can:

- Set `SESSION_CONTEXT` to a **comma-separated string**:

  ```python
  user_groups = "lion-uk-users,lion-fr-users"
  cursor.execute("EXEC sp_set_session_context @key=N'group_names', @value=?;", (user_groups,))
  ```

- Adjust your SQL predicate function to support multi-group logic using `STRING_SPLIT()`.

But to keep it **simple and performant**, enforce **one group per session** in early stages.

---

## üîê Why This Is Secure and Clean

‚úÖ **App code stays clean** ‚Äî no filtering logic in Flask
‚úÖ **DB enforces access** ‚Äî no way to bypass RLS even with a rogue query
‚úÖ **Easy to extend** ‚Äî you can add RLS to other tables with `group_name`

---

## üß™ Test This End-to-End

1. Deploy your RLS policy
2. Add some test data with different `group_name` values
3. Log in as different users (with different Entra groups)
4. In Flask, after token validation, set:

   ```python
   user_group = g.user.get("groups", [])[0]  # Assuming 1 group for now
   cursor.execute("EXEC sp_set_session_context @key=N'group_name', @value=?;", (user_group,))
   ```

5. Query your table without any `WHERE` clause ‚Äî and it will return **only the permitted rows**

---

## Question:

should i run it after every new table created?

Excellent question ‚Äî this is where most people get confused when implementing **Row-Level Security (RLS)** in Azure SQL.
Let‚Äôs clarify it cleanly üëá

---

## ‚úÖ Short Answer

No ‚Äî
you **don‚Äôt need to recreate the `fn_securitypredicate_groupname` function** every time you create a new table.

But you **do need to attach the security policy to each table** that should be protected by RLS.

---

## üß© Think of it Like This

| Object                             | Purpose                                            | When You Create It                   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `fn_securitypredicate_groupname()` | Defines _how_ to filter (the rule)                 | Once, reused for all tables          |
| `CREATE SECURITY POLICY`           | Defines _where_ to apply it (which tables/columns) | Once per table that needs protection |

---

## üîß Example

You already have this once (you do **not** repeat it):

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fn_securitypredicate_groupname(@group_name AS NVARCHAR(100))
RETURNS TABLE
WITH SCHEMABINDING
AS
RETURN SELECT 1 AS fn_securitypredicate_groupname
WHERE @group_name = CAST(SESSION_CONTEXT(N'group_name') AS NVARCHAR(100));
```

Now suppose you have 3 tables:

- `shipments`
- `drivers`
- `depots`

Each has a column `group_name`.

You create **a new security policy for each**:

```sql
CREATE SECURITY POLICY RLS_shipments
ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.fn_securitypredicate_groupname(group_name)
ON dbo.shipments
WITH (STATE = ON);

CREATE SECURITY POLICY RLS_drivers
ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.fn_securitypredicate_groupname(group_name)
ON dbo.drivers
WITH (STATE = ON);

CREATE SECURITY POLICY RLS_depots
ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.fn_securitypredicate_groupname(group_name)
ON dbo.depots
WITH (STATE = ON);
```

‚úÖ You reuse the same function each time.
‚úÖ You only define the policy once per table that needs filtering.

---

## üß† Optional Enhancements (for later)

If you also want to filter by `user_id` in the future:

- You can create another predicate function (e.g. `fn_securitypredicate_userid`)
- Or modify the same function to consider both `group_name` **and** `user_id`.

---

## üîÑ Maintenance Tip

If later you add a new table (say `routes`),
just create a new **security policy** reusing the same function:

```sql
CREATE SECURITY POLICY RLS_routes
ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.fn_securitypredicate_groupname(group_name)
ON dbo.routes
WITH (STATE = ON);
```

You never have to touch the function again.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Task                         | How Often             | Purpose                            |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Create predicate function    | Once                  | Defines filtering logic            |
| Create security policy       | Once per table        | Applies that logic to table        |
| Set session context in Flask | Every request/session | Passes user‚Äôs group context to SQL |

---

Would you like me to show you how to make a **parameterized RLS function** that works for _both_ `group_name` and `user_id`, so that later you can add user-specific restrictions too (e.g., only ‚Äúgroup_admin‚Äù can see all rows)?
