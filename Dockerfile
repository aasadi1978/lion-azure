# Set the following system settings when deploying through docker image
# When deploying through a prebuilt Docker image, the application is already fully built and packaged, so Azure App Service should not attempt 
# to rebuild or modify it during deployment or startup. To ensure this, the settings SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=false and WEBSITES_DISABLE_ORYX=true 
# are applied. The first setting disables the Kudu build process that normally runs during source-based deployments, while the second prevents Oryx — Azure’s 
# automatic runtime detection and build tool — from running inside the container at startup. Together, these settings ensure Azure runs the container exactly as 
# built, avoiding unnecessary build steps, startup errors, or runtime conflicts.
# SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT = false when using Docker
# WEBSITES_DISABLE_ORYX=true
