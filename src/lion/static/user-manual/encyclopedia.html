<span id="id1"></span><h2>Movement<a class="headerlink" href="#movement" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In transportation and logistics, a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Movement</span></code> refers to the complete journey of a vehicle from its point of origin to its destination.
It encompasses all aspects of the transit, including the vehicle’s departure time from the origin, the route taken, and the arrival time at the
destination. This term is broadly applicable to various modes of transportation, such as cars, trucks, trains, ships, and aircraft. Each movement is
characterized by its unique set of parameters such as distance, duration, and the nature of goods or passengers being transported, providing a
comprehensive overview of the transit process.</p>
</section>
<section id="changeover">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Changeover<a class="headerlink" href="#changeover" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the realm of transportation, a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Changeover</span></code> or a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">multi-leg</span> <span class="pre">movement</span></code>, refers to a sequence of interconnected
<a class="reference internal" href="#movement"><span class="std std-ref">movements</span></a>, where each <a class="reference internal" href="#movement"><span class="std std-ref">movement</span></a> is linked to the next by specific departure and arrival times. These sequences are carefully coordinated to ensure smooth
transitions between each leg of the journey. The timing between successive movements, known as <em>changeover time</em>, is critical. It allows
time to process and exchange trailer between drivers. However, if one movement in the sequence is delayed, it might necessitate the adjustment of subsequent
movements to maintain the integrity of the overall schedule.</p>
<p>In FedEx, the creation of changeovers primarily addresses challenges associated with lengthy (exceeding 4.5 hours of driving time)
and time-sensitive movements. Consider, for instance, the transportation of a unit from Kingsbury, UK, to Edinburgh, UK.
This journey exceeds six hours, making it impractical to complete in compliance with <a class="reference internal" href="regulations.html#regulations"><span class="std std-ref">regulations</span></a> without being double-manned.
To circumvent this issue, a changeover is strategically implemented. A typical solution involves establishing a transfer point,
such as in Preston. Here, coordinators can efficiently arrange for the continuation of the journey, managing connections and transfers to
prevent delays. This system ensures that longer journeys remain feasible and compliant with <a class="reference internal" href="regulations.html#regulations"><span class="std std-ref">regulations</span></a> within operational constraints.</p>
<p>Let us deep dive in the Preston example. Assume that the above mentioned changeover involves two linked movements (M1 and M2):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>M1: The first movement is from Kingsbury to Preston. The truck departs at 22:00 and arrives at 00:25 the next day.</p></li>
<li><p>M2: The second movement, from Preston to Edinburgh, begins shortly after. This truck is scheduled to leave Preston at 00:40 and
reach Edinburgh at 04:50.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Between these two movements, there is a planned 15-minute changeover time, specifically allocated for transferring
the trailer. This changeover time is crucial for ensuring a smooth transition between the movements.</p>
<p>Imagine a situation where the first truck, designated for the Preston leg of a journey, experiences a delay of an hour.
Consequently, the schedule for the subsequent movement, heading towards Edinburgh, must be recalibrated where possible. This rescheduling
is essential to guarantee that the trailer departs for Edinburgh on time. Such a cascade of delays and the required adjustments
in the timings of successive movements epitomize what we term a <em>Changeover</em> in truck transportation. Essentially, a Changeover is
the coordination and realignment of sequential movements to ensure timely deliveries, despite disruptions or delays in earlier segments.</p>
<p>In the context of LION, a changeover is displayed by its location string. In the example above, the loc_string would be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">KG4.PN4.EDH.2200</span></code>.
Every changeover, has a final destination called <em>Transportation Unit</em> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TU</span></code> Destination which is a location where the trailer is destined for.</p>

<section id="tour-shift">
<span id="tour"></span><h2>Tour (Shift)<a class="headerlink" href="#tour-shift" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A tour or shift, in the Context of LION, is a sequence of <a class="reference internal" href="#movement"><span class="std std-ref">Movement</span></a> s that are conducted by a single driver. This definition
emphasizes the role of the driver in connecting each movement in the sequence.</p>
</section>
<section id="traffic-type">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Traffic Type<a class="headerlink" href="#traffic-type" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the context of transportation, particularly within a transportation or logistics company like FedEx Express, the term <strong>Traffic Type</strong> refers to the
classification of a transportation lane or route based on the nature of the cargo movement or the mode of transport being used. This classification
helps in organizing and managing the logistics process more efficiently. Here’s a brief explanation of some of traffic types:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Air Exports</strong>: These are lanes/movements for goods being exported out of a country from Origin to an air gateway where they
are either loose loaded or caged.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Air Export - ULDs</strong>: These are lanes / movements for goods being exported out of a country from Origin to an air gateway in ULD’s</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Air Exports - ADR</strong>: These are lanes / movements for goods being exported out of a country
from Origin to an air gateway but require an ADR qualified driver (dangerous goods)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Air Import</strong>: These are lanes / movements for goods being imported into a country from an air gateway to a destination where
they are either loose loaded or caged</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Air Import - ULD</strong>: These are lanes / movements for goods being imported into a country from an air gateway to a destination in ULD’s</p></li>
<li><p><strong>B Service</strong>: These are lanes / movements for goods that have a 2 day service for sorting the next shift</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Empty</strong>: An empty movement is essentially a repositioning movement where an empty trailer is left in exchange for a loaded trailer</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Empty - Cages</strong>: An empty movement is essentially a repositioning movement where an empty trailer is left in exchange for a
loaded trailer but the location it goes to requires cages replenished</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Empty - palletts</strong>: An empty movement is essentially a repositioning movement where an empty trailer is left in exchange for a
loaded trailer but the location it goes to requires palletts replenished</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Empty - ULDs</strong>: An empty movement is essentially a repositioning movement where an empty trailer is left in exchange for
a loaded trailer but the location it goes to requires ULD’s replenished</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Empty Double Deck</strong>: Same as empty but it’s a double deck trailer</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Express</strong>: These are lanes / movments that carry domestic shipments for next day delivery</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Express - ADR</strong>: These are lanes / movments that carry domestic shipments for next day delivery but require an ADR qualifies driver (dangerous goods)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Express - Scottish</strong>: These are lanes / movments that carry domestic shipments for next day delivery containing Scottish deadline traffic. Scottish is
only permitted on designated lines as there is an earlier cut off time so the hubs can identify these and prioritise them for sorting</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Express Double Deck</strong>: These are lanes / movments that carry domestic shipments for next day delivery but are on a double deck trailer</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Express Double Deck - Scottish</strong>: These are lanes / movments that carry domestic shipments for next day delivery containing Scottish
deadline traffic but are on a double deck trailer. Scottish is only permitted on designated lines as there
is an earlier cut off time so the hubs can identify these and prioritise them for sorting</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Returns</strong>: A loaded trailer containing shioments to be returned to a specific customer</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Road Exports</strong>: These are lanes / movements for goods being exported out of a country from Origin to a road transit hub</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Road Imports</strong>: These are lanes / movements for goods being imported into a country from a road transit hub to a destination</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shuttle</strong>: These are lanes / movements for goods being shuttled between locations where the origin does not have a connection to the destination</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shuttle - Scottish</strong>: These are lanes / movements for Scottish goods being shuttled between locations where the origin does not have a connection to
Scotland. This allows the receiving hub to prioritise the trailer for sorting</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solo</strong>: This is where a tractor unit travels on its own with no trailer attached</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these traffic types has its unique requirements, regulations, and operational procedures. By categorizing lanes
into these types, a transportation company can better streamline its operations, allocate resources, and provide specialized services
according to the specific needs of each lane.</p>

<section id="controlling-location-station">
<span id="ctrl-loc"></span><h2>Controlling location (Station)<a class="headerlink" href="#controlling-location-station" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The controlling location (station) refers to the site responsible for managing drivers and additional resources to
and from the customer’s location. From <em>Driver Plan</em> reporting perspective, any departure and arrival information from and to
customer’s location will be shared with the controlling station.</p>
</section>
<section id="latitude-and-longitude">
<span id="lat-lon"></span><h2>Latitude and longitude<a class="headerlink" href="#latitude-and-longitude" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Latitude and longitude are a pair of numbers (coordinates) used to describe a position on the plane of a
geographic coordinate system. The numbers are in decimal degrees format and range from -90 to 90 for latitude and
-180 to 180 for longitude. For example, Washington DC has a latitude 38.8951 and longitude -77.0364.</p>
<p>To obtain a location coordinates, you can go to <a class="reference external" href="https://maps.google.com">Goolge Maps</a>, search for the location.
Once happy with the location and corresponding details, right click on the spot on the google map and copy the coordinates
as displayed in the screen shot below. It is important to get these numbers as accurate as possible by zooming in and making sure
that the right address and point is selected.</p>

<section id="turnaround-time">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>Turnaround time<a class="headerlink" href="#turnaround-time" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This term refers to the essential interval incorporated into each stopping point of a driver’s work cycle within a shift.
It is composed of two distinct phases:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Driving Turnaround Time</strong>: This is the time allocated for a driver to gradually reduce speed upon reaching a facility and
to come to a complete halt within the premises. It ensures a smooth and safe transition from active driving to a stationary state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-Driving Turnaround Time</strong>: After the Driving Turnaround Time, a designated period is provided for the driver to manage
necessary administrative tasks. This includes processing paperwork relevant to the upcoming <a class="reference internal" href="#movement"><span class="std std-ref">movement</span></a>. This phase is
crucial for the preparation required before embarking on the next segment of the journey. Additionally, this time may be utilized,
if there are trailers to be swapped, for conducting vehicle or trailer checks prior to re-entering public highways. This ensures not only the administrative
readiness but also the operational safety of the vehicle for the ensuing travel.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, Turnaround Time at each stopping point in a driver’s shift or tour integrates the transition from driving to rest
(Driving Turnaround Time) and the preparation for the next driving segment (Non-Driving Turnaround Time), ensuring operational
efficiency and safety.</p>
</section>
<section id="debrief-time">
<span id="debrief"></span><h2>Debrief time<a class="headerlink" href="#debrief-time" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Debrief time in the context of a transportation company is a designated period at the beginning and end of a shift where
drivers can prepare for their workday and then later reflect on and discuss it. <em>Debreif time</em> is considered as part of “Duty” hours:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>Pre-Shift Debrief (30 minutes at the beginning of the shift):</strong></dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This time is allocated for preparing for the day’s work. It often involves reviewing the day’s schedule, checking vehicles or equipment,
and discussing any important updates or safety reminders.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Activities:</strong> Employees might review their routes, receive any last-minute changes, check the condition of their vehicle, and
ensure they have all necessary equipment. It’s also a time for supervisors to communicate any relevant information about the day’s tasks.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>Post-Shift Debrief (30 minutes at the end of the shift):</strong></dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This period is for reflecting on the day’s work, discussing any challenges or incidents, and providing feedback. It’s an opportunity
to learn from the day’s experiences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Activities:</strong> Employees may report on the status of their tasks, any issues encountered, and suggestions for improvement. It’s
also a time to complete any necessary paperwork and ensure that vehicles and equipment are left in good condition for the next shift.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Effective communication, safety, and continuous learning is critical. It’s not just about the tasks but also about engaging with colleagues and
supervisors to share experiences and gain insights.</p>
