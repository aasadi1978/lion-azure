Welcome to LION's documentation. 

Introduction
------------

As a company, we are constantly looking for ways to improve our operations and efficiency. One area where we can make 
significant improvements is in our network and resource optimization/scheduling processes. In the previous state, 
we relied on an external consultancy company and their tool to handle these tasks. While the tool has served us well 
during the past almost two decades, it is time for us to take ownership of these critical processes and develop an 
in-house solution.

Linehaul Optimization for Network, or LION for short, is an in-house state of the art logistics 
optimization tool developed in **Europe Road Network Planning & Engineering** department within **FedEx Express**. The software is 
designed to help efficiently manage resources and drivers. The tool uses advanced algorithms and mathematical optimization 
techniques to identify the most efficient assignment of drivers to vehicles between 
different locations, considering factors such as driver location, distance and runtimes, labor regulations and driver availability. 
Key features includes but not limited to:

- Improved efficiency & Compliance Validation with all key processes automated.
- Interactive Shift Details to speed up network changes.
- Improved  Communication between teams with tailor made documentation and driver plans.
- Effortless Data Sharing, Extraction and Reporting.
