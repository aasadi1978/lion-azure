    The key driver labor regulations in the UK for truck drivers concerning maximum driving time, break time rules, 
    and working time rules are as follows (please visit `GOV.UK <https://www.gov.uk/guidance/drivers-hours-goods-vehicles/1-eu-and-aetr-rules-on-drivers-hours>`_):

    1. Breaks from Driving: A driver must take a break of at least 45 minutes after a driving period of no more than 4.5 hours. 
       This break can be split into two parts: the first break being at least 15 minutes and the second at least 30 minutes, distributed over 
       the 4.5-hour period​  
    
    
    2.  Daily Driving Limit: The maximum daily driving time is 9 hours, which can be 
        extended to 10 hours but no more than twice in a fixed week.

    3.  Weekly Driving Limit: The maximum weekly driving limit is 56 hours in a fixed week, which starts at 00:00 on Monday and ends at 24:00 on the 
        following Sunday​​.

    4.  Two-Weekly Driving Limit: Over any two-week period, the maximum driving time should not exceed 90 hours​​.

    5.  Daily Rest: A driver must take a minimum of 11 continuous hours of rest daily, which can be reduced to 9 continuous hours up to three 
        times between weekly rest periods. This rest period can be split into two parts, with the first being at least 3 hours long and the second at least 9 
        hours long, and must be completed within 24 hours of the end of the previous daily or weekly rest period​​.

    6.  Multi-Manning Daily Rest: For multi-manned vehicles, a daily rest of at least 9 hours must be taken within a 30-hour period 
        starting from the end of the last daily or weekly rest period​​.

    7.  Ferry/Train Daily Rest: Regular daily rest periods (of at least 11 hours) or weekly rest periods can be interrupted no 
        more than twice for other activities not exceeding 1 hour in total, provided the driver accompanies a vehicle traveling by ferry or 
        train and has access to a sleeper cabin, bunk, or couchette. This interruption is allowed only if the ferry or train leg of the journey 
        is scheduled for 8 hours or more​​.

    These regulations are designed to ensure driver safety and compliance with legal standards in the UK.
